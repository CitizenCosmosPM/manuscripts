**[A citizen odyssey, ep. XIV, special mission: Neutron.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umvecK_toi4)**
{{ youtube(id="umvecK_toi4", autoplay=true, class="youtube") }}

This time during the citizen odyssey we discussed different topics around the [Neutron project](https://www.citizencosmos.space/neutron). Our guests were [Soi](https://twitter.com/soi2studio) - community manager with great experience in communication, [Spaydh](https://twitter.com/0xSpaydh) - general manager and [Mike](https://twitter.com/pr0n00gler) - Go/Rust Senior Developer who is og in cosmos, almost from the beginning . He developed a lot of different tools, but never launched blockchain, so it was the first case with the neutron project. 
The discussed topics were ics, interoperability, cosmwasm, smart contracts, implementation, dapps  and much more!

Citizen Cosmos, [being a participant](https://github.com/neutron-org/testnets) of the Neutron's testnet, called members of the team to get answers for common questions.<br><br>

**Q: Who will use the Neutron?**

Basically there will be ordinary users who will use Neutron to do stuff and then developers and people building businesses on top of Neutron. For the people who use the blockchain the goal is to create kind of a home in The Interchain. It's a chain that you can use to access everything else in The Interchain. For example, you want to do a swap on Osmosis? You can do it from Neutron, because there's an Outpost â€” like a proxy, like a contract. You don't need to bridge back and forth the smart contracts. You just go to the interface, you click the button, you sign one transaction. Everything happens in the background, and you get what you want. Don't have to care about the fact that these are multiple blockchains connected by IBC. For users it's going to be a home in The Interchain and for developers it's going to be a command center.

**Q: Why are smart contract platforms needed and, in particular, why smart contracts created by Neutron are needed?**<br>

Smart contracts do one thing, but they do it very, very well. Smart contracts are more versatile and lightweight, and bringing them to Cosmos is a way to hopefully increase the velocity.<br>

**Q: How is Neutron different? What is the Neutron value proposition?**<br>

There are two: security and interoperability. There are actually others but let's focus on these two. Interchain security allows us to have the same security at launch as the Cosmos Hub, one of the top 10 most secure proof-of-stake blockchains. The second thing is interoperability. Basically, on most smart contract platforms today, the app you release on that blockchain only works on that blockchain. The point of Neutron is to try to allow you to create applications that work on Neutron but also work on all of the blockchains that are connected by IBC. Instead of having every Chain has different dapps and you need to adapt to this, perhaps we can make a version of Cosmos where  you have one front end for every application and you don't need to care about which blockchain you're on . You can just use the services you want to use from wherever you are in Cosmos . And then get the assets you want to get on whatever chain you want to get them. Essentially basically we're trying to remove all the complexity of having multiple blockchains in the same ecosystem and just make it way easier to navigate.


***In conclusion,*** a quick Q&A session was held, during which some advantages of Cosmos SDK were pointed out.
