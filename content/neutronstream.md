**[A citizen odyssey, ep. XIV, special mission: Neutron.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umvecK_toi4)**
{{ youtube(id="umvecK_toi4", autoplay=true, class="youtube") }}

This time, during our citizen odyssey, we discussed different topics around the [Neutron project](https://www.citizencosmos.space/neutron). Our guests were [Soi](https://twitter.com/soi2studio) - community manager with great experience in communication, [Spaydh](https://twitter.com/0xSpaydh) - general manager and [Mike](https://twitter.com/pr0n00gler) - Go/Rust Senior Developer who is OG in Cosmos, almost from the beginning. He developed a lot of different tools, but never launched blockchain, so it was the first case with the Neutron project. 
The discussed topics were Interchain Security, interoperability, CosmWasm, smart contracts, implementation, dApps and much more.

Citizen Cosmos, [being a participant](https://github.com/neutron-org/testnets) of the Neutron's testnet, called members of the team to get answers for common questions.<br><br>

**Q: Who will use the Neutron?**

Basically there will be ordinary users who will use Neutron to do stuff and then developers and people building businesses on top of Neutron. For the people who use the blockchain the goal is to create kind of a home in The Interchain. It's a chain that you can use to access everything else in The Interchain. For example, you want to do a swap on [Osmosis](https://www.citizencosmos.space/osmosis)? You can do it from Neutron, because there's an Outpost — like a proxy, like a contract. You don't need to bridge back and forth the smart contracts. You just go to the interface, you click the button, you sign one transaction. Everything happens in the background, and you get what you want. Don't have to care about the fact that these are multiple blockchains connected by IBC. For users it's going to be a home in The Interchain and for developers it's going to be a command center.

**Q: Why are smart contract platforms needed and, in particular, why smart contracts created by Neutron are needed?**<br>

Smart contracts do one thing, but they do it very, very well. Smart contracts are more versatile and lightweight, and bringing them to [Cosmos](https://www.citizencosmos.space/ethan-buchman-cosmos) is a way to hopefully increase the velocity.<br>

**Q: How is Neutron different? What is the Neutron value proposition?**<br>

There are two: security and interoperability. There are actually others but let's focus on these two. Interchain security allows us to have the same security at launch as the Cosmos Hub, one of the top 10 most secure proof-of-stake blockchains. The second thing is interoperability. Basically, on most smart contract platforms today, the app you release on that blockchain only works on that blockchain. The point of Neutron is to try to allow you to create applications that work on Neutron but also work on all of the blockchains that are connected by [IBC](https://www.citizencosmos.space/game-of-zones). Every chain has different dApps, and you need to adapt to this. Perhaps we can make a version of Cosmos where you have one front end for every application and you don't need to care about which blockchain you're on. You can just use the services you want to use from wherever you are in Cosmos. And then get the assets you want to get on whatever chain you want to get them. Essentially, we're trying to remove all the complexity of having multiple blockchains in the same ecosystem and just make it way easier to navigate.

**Q: Were there any things with the Neutron testing that came as a surprise in a bad way or in a good way?**<br>

Mike: I'm pretty familiar with Cosmos ecosystem, the technical side of things, so there were no surprises for me.

**Q: Maybe there were surprises for validators?**<br>

Spaydh: Interchain security changes Neutron and the others. We are secured by Atom, but we can't mint Atom. So when we launch we're not going to create a whole bunch of Atoms. Also this means that we can't do foundation delegations. Unfortunately. We appreciate tremendously the fact that a lot of validators have been very interested in committing and stuff but every time we get asked like “Hey, can we get a delegation in exchange for it?”, but unfortunately we don't have the Atom that it takes to make a delegation. So sorry.

**Q: Will there be a token on Neutron, its own token?**<br>

Spaydh: Yeah, most likely. The idea is how do we make an incentives game that allows people to create value to bring new stuff to experiment, to create new protocols, new applications to make cool community events, all that kind of stuff. And how do we ensure that people participate in this are rewarded when they contribute? People are punished when they try to destroy things or to do things that hurt the blockchain. For example,  trying to spam transactions. The token kind of serves that purpose. It also provides a tool to make decisions together, governance.

**Q: What is the future of Neutron?**<br>

Soi: Cosmos is frankly a little bit behind the times in terms of DeFi. There's a lot of stuff that you can do on Ethereum that you can't do on Cosmos yet. And we like to think that Neutron is going to open the door to the the future of Defi in Cosmos. In five years, what we're going to see on the platform? We're going to see lending protocols, money markets, taxes and really sort of open the door to the future of DeFi in Cosmos.

**Q: What's in your opinion, for the community what comes first DeFI or NFT?**<br>
