## How to create a cyberlinks ##

To create a cyberlink in Bostrom neuron needs to have any number of Ampere and 1 or more Volt tokens on his balance.

For each staked BOOT a HYDROGEN(H) is minted (with a 1 to 1 ratio). With this HYDROGEN we can do "investmint" for a limited period to produce VOLT and AMPERE tokens (they are needed to create cyberlinks).

To do this go to [cyb.ai](https://cyb.ai/) and click on **HFR**(Note that I currently have an empty battery):

<!-- more -->

Here we can choose the amount of HYDROGENE(H) and the period for which we want to freeze them. By moving the slider you will see how the amount of Volts changes:

After selecting the amount of H and the period for which they are frozen, click on **Investmint**:

Now, we need to obtain Ampere tokens. To do this click on AMPERE(A)
