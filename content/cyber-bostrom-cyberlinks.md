## How to create a cyberlinks ##

To create a cyberlink in Bostrom neuron needs to have any number of Ampere and 1 or more Volt tokens on his balance.

For each staked BOOT a HYDROGEN is minted (with a 1 to 1 ratio). With this HYDROGEN we can do "investmint" for a limited period to produce VOLT and AMPERE tokens (they are needed to create cyberlinks).

To do this go to [cyb.ai](https://cyb.ai/) and click on **HFR**(Note that I currently have an empty battery):

Here we can choose the amount of BOOT and the period for which we want to freeze them:
