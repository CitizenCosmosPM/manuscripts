## How to create a cyberlinks ##

A cyberlink is a link between two particles registered in Bostrom blockchain by a particular neuron.
To create a cyberlink in Bostrom neurons needs to have any number of Ampere and 1 or more Volt tokens on their balance.

For each staked **BOOT** a **HYDROGEN(H)** is minted (at a 1 to 1 ratio). With this **HYDROGEN** we can do "investmint" for a limited period(1 to 520 days) to produce **VOLT** and **AMPERE** tokens (both are needed to create cyberlinks).

To get started go to [cyb.ai](https://cyb.ai/) and click on **HFR**(Note that I currently have an empty battery):

<!-- more -->

Here we can choose the amount of **HYDROGENE(H)** and the period for which we want to freeze them. By moving the slider you will see how the amount of **VOLTS(V)** changes:

After selecting the amount of **HYDROGENE(H)** and the period for which they are frozen, click on **Investmint**:

Now, we need to obtain **AMPERE** tokens. To do this click on **AMPERE(A)**:

Here we can choose the amount of **HYDROGENE(H)** and the period for which we want to freeze them. By moving the slider you will see how the amount of **AMPERE(A)** changes, after selecting the amount of **H** and the period for which they are frozen, click on **Investmint** :

Now we have **AMPERE(A)** and **VOLT(V)**:

The battery shows how much **Energy(W)** is now available. Energy (W) is the product of ampers and volts :

**ENERGY(W)** = **VOLT(V)** x **AMPERE(A)**

Our battery is not empty, by clicking on it we will see how many cyberlinks we can create. The battery will fill up during the day:

We can now create a cyberlink. To do this, write in the search box query, which should give our result, for example - Citizen cosmos:

[![Screenshot-546.png](https://i.postimg.cc/85HPk5dy/Screenshot-546.png)](https://postimg.cc/LYJMNmbf)

We see the results that are returned by our query:

[![Screenshot-547.png](https://i.postimg.cc/3xmhJNYg/Screenshot-547.png)](https://postimg.cc/9DmKLW4M)

To get our result for this request, we can attach an image, text, or a hash - this is the creation of the cyberlink:

I'll provide a link to the Citizen Cosmos Twitter here:

[![Screenshot-549.png](https://i.postimg.cc/pLsTzkm2/Screenshot-549.png)](https://postimg.cc/4YhsT6vM)

Now, when you search for "Citizen Cosmos" in the search box, my result will also be displayed:

In the same way you can create a cyberlink with an image, video, document:

Select the file you want to upload and click on **Open**:

Great, we created a cyberlink with the logo Citizen Cosmos:
